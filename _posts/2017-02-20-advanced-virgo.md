On the 20th of February 2017 the installation of the Advanced Virgo has concluded :-D 

This does not mean the detector will immediately start collecting science data - some time is needed for various commissioning. Depending on how it will go, Virgo will try to join Advanced LIGO sometime before the end of the O2 run (i.e. before the summer).
