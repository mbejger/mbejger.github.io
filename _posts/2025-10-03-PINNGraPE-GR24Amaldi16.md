This GR24/Amaldi 16 proceedings paper is a current summary of the PINNGraPE implementation for rapid and accurate gravitational wave parameter estimation using physics-informed neural networks, a work-in progress with Leigh Smith, Matteo Scialpi and Francesco di Clemente (see [the arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02858) for more details). 

Ultimately, we aim to produce a method which will complement existing weakly-modeled searches, such as the [Coherent WaveBurst (cWB)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12604) pipeline.
