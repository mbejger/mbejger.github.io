The Einstein Telescope (ET) is a proposed third-generation (under)ground-based gravitational wave detector. The ET consortium has recently released a comprehensive overview of the science case for the ET in [arXiv:2503.12263](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12263) (now also published in *Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics*). 

The science of ET is broad, covering astrophysics, cosmology, fundamental physics, nuclear physics, and multimessenger and multiwavelength astronomy. With many colleagues working on all the science aspects ET can observe, I contributed, among other things, to the section on ''Tools for assessing the scientific potentials of detector configurations'' as this section's co-coordinator.
