Probing the properties of matter at supranuclear densities is a fundamental challenge in both nuclear physics and astrophysics. In [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23506), we present a novel approach to inferring the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars using neural posterior estimation (NPE) techniques applied to EM and GW observations. 

This work is another in a series of projects with Valéria Carvalho, Márcio Ferreira and Constança Providência (see also [Conditional variational autoencoder inference of neutron star equation of state from astrophysical observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14266) and [Detecting the third family of compact stars with normalizing flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09398))
