We report on a new all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves in the
frequency band 475--2000 Hz and with a frequency time derivative in the range
of $[-1.0, +0.1]\times 10^{-8}$ Hz/s. Potential signals could be produced by a
nearby spinning and slightly non-axisymmetric isolated neutron star in our
galaxy.  This search uses the data from Advanced LIGO's first observational run
O1. No gravitational wave signals were observed, and upper limits were placed
on their strengths. For completeness, results from the separately published low
frequency search 20--475 Hz are included as well.  Our lowest upper limit on
worst-case (linearly polarized) strain amplitude $h_0$ is  ${\sim} 4\times 10^{-25}$
near 170 Hz, while at the high end of our frequency range we achieve a
worst-case upper limit of ${1.3}\times 10^{-24}$. For a circularly polarized source
(most favorable orientation), the smallest upper limit obtained is
${\sim}{1.5}\times 10^{-25}$.
