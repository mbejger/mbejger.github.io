2021 was rather busy for the continuous gravitational waves (CW) LVK working group.  

We have searched for GWs from known neutron stars: 

* [Search for continuous gravitational waves from 20 accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars in O3 LIGO data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09255) 
* [Searches for Gravitational Waves from Known Pulsars at Two Harmonics in the Second and Third LIGO-Virgo Observing Runs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13106) 
* [Narrowband searches for continuous and long-duration transient gravitational waves from known pulsars in the LIGO-Virgo third observing run](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10990) 

emission from sources located in supernova remnants: 

* [Search of the Early O3 LIGO Data for Continuous Gravitational Waves from the Cassiopeia A and Vela Jr. Supernova Remnants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15116) 

unknown sources located anywhere in the sky: 

* [All-sky search for continuous gravitational waves from isolated neutron stars using Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo O3 data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00697) 

and sources related to dark matter and scalar bosons: 
 
* [Constraints on dark photon dark matter using data from LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13085) 
* [All-sky search for gravitational wave emission from scalar boson clouds around spinning black holes in LIGO O3 data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15507)
