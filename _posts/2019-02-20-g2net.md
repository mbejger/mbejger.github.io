A new COST action [G2net](http://www.g2net.eu), dedicated to the synergy between GW astronomy, machine learning and geophysics (since our detectors are located on the ground) has just starting. Exciting times! :-) 

There are three [working groups](http://www.g2net.eu/wgs): 

* WG1: Machine Learning for Gravitational Wave astronomy
* WG2: Machine Learning for low-frequency seismic measurement
* WG3: Machine Learning for Advanced Control techniques

with funding available for [Short Term Scientific Missions](http://www.g2net.eu/short-term-scientific-missions-stsms) and [Inclusiveness Target Countries](http://www.g2net.eu/itc-grants) conference grants. If you are interested, write to me.  

*Incoming*: [Data Science in (Astro)particle Physics and Cosmology (25-29 March 2019)](http://www.g2net.eu/news/data-science-in-astroparticle-physics-and-cosmology) school in Braga, Portugal, co-funded and organized by G2net.
