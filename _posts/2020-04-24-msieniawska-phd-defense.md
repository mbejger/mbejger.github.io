At the end of April, in the middle of self-isolation quarantine and pandemic, mgr Magda Sieniawska successfully defended her [PhD thesis](https://www.camk.edu.pl/media/uploads_current/rada_naukowa/przewody_doktorskie/msieniawska/ms_phdthesis.pdf), of which I was the adviser. Congratulations! 

The PhD thesis is based on 4 published articles: 

* [Estimating the equation of state from measurements of neutron star radii with 5% accuracy](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2018/08/aa33071-18/aa33071-18.html)
* [Tidal deformability and other global parameters of compact stars with strong phase transitions](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/02/aa33969-18/aa33969-18.html)
* [Follow-up procedure for gravitational wave searches from isolated neutron stars using the time-domain $\mathcal{F}$-statistic method](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ab3ee5)
* [Continuous Gravitational Waves from Neutron Stars: Current Status and Prospects](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/5/11/217)

The Scientific Council of CAMK honored the defence _summa cum laude_. The recording of the defence is [available on youtube](youtube.com/watch?v=QnH-2lA189o).
